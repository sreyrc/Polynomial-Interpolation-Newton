# Polynomial-Interpolation-Newton

The third project for our math class, MAT 500: Curves and Surfaces, at DigiPen Institute of Technology. We had to create an application that generates a Newton's Divided Differences interpolating polynomial curve from interpolation points that the user places on the screen.

Made in Qt 5.15.0 using the qcustomplot library
